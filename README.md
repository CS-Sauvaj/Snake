#Snake
The Snake game :p
Run java -jar Snake.jar to launch the game.
You can also double click the Snake.jar file.
Commands are arrows (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) to move the snake.
You can pause the game with space.
You can chose the difficulty between 1 and 5. 
The less the difficulty is, the less your speed will be.
Eating an apple makes you win the same amount of points as your difficulty.
You can let the AI play. It is hard coded and not perfect. Press A to leave the loop.
Music and game upgrades are in progress...
